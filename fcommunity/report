- What my project is, why I have decided to do it, why would it be helpful,
    what challenges does it make? real life examples?

- What my initial idea was, why did we end up with this idea

- Why Django instead of any other back-end framework, Why python and not
    JS or Java

- Why React for front-end and not the Django front-end or any other
    front-end framework

- How did I implement them together, were there any other options,
    why did I choose this way of implementing it

- Why mySQL for dbs and not anything else

- database and different tables in it, why is everything there,
    why are some things missing
    (e.g. age restriction, comments on user profiles, ratings for users...)

- talk about possible problems due to the app being based on actual people
    (e.g. not showing up for matches, trying to cheat about match outcomes...)
    and how would I try to prevent them from happening in a good way

- talk about security and Django-implemented CSRF

- talk about user's locations and how this is handled without
    giving away personal information

- age restriction also helps with not giving away personal information
    like needing to know user's birtdhay

- User and team descriptions

- Why do I use Google Maps and why is it essential

- How will I schedule matches for competitions

- team options(closed, open, needs approval...)

- team captains

- how to deal with inactive users that cramp up player spots in teams,
    maybe even inactive captains

- user can be a part of multiple teams as long as they are at
    at least a specific distance away from any of his other teams

- team gets automatically created if there are no teams near a new user
    to deal with clustering problem without using algorithms

- Automatically propose competitions for nearby teams,
    willing to change team checkbox -> clustering problem

- Why Kmeans for clustering instead of mean-shift or hierarchical clustering

- single matches, single-team matches

- how to make sure users have a general idea of how good a team is
    (team ratings)

- Football pitches, have users contribute to adding them,
    have them rate and comment them

- team chats and match chats to help with organising

- match chats with votes for deciding on time and place?

- test data

- Kmeans
